"""
Shake structures P1, P2, P3 of the GVNS (D015).

They are separate from the neighborhoods N1, N2, N3 used by the VND: the
neighborhoods intensify, the perturbations move the search to progressively
more distant regions. All of them preserve pile mass and mineral eligibility.

Unlike the local search, perturbations pick truck slots (positions) uniformly,
as in the position-based wording of the case: a random truck is chosen, so a
mineral that fills more slots of a pile is more likely to be touched.

    P1 (small):   replace the mineral of ``n_positions`` random slots.
    P2 (medium):  ejection chain over ``chain_length`` distinct piles:
                  p1 receives a new mineral, p_{i+1} receives the mineral that
                  left p_i, and the mineral of the last pile leaves the solution.
    P3 (strong):  cyclic permutation of one slot from each of ``n_piles`` piles
                  of the same sinter group (global usage is unchanged).
